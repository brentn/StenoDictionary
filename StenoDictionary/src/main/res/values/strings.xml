    <string name="about_text"><i>Machine Stenography</i> (court reporting) uses a <i>chording</i> keyboard to provide the ability to type text at speeds that exceed that of human speech.
Unfortunately it takes quite a bit of work to learn, and until recently, expensive hardware/software to get started.<br/>

Plover (http://stenoknight.com/wiki/Getting_Started) is an open-source project that allows anyone to try-out Machine Stenography on ausing an inexpensive ($50-$100) keyboard, OR a full-fledged steno machine.

There are also several excellent training guides available:

https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc
http://ploverdojo.appspot.com/

While it doesn’t seem practical to achieve these speeds using a virtual keyboard,  it is possible to exceed “hunt-and-peck”, “thumb-typing” or even “swype” speeds.

These tools are designed primarily to aid those learning machine stenography to become more familiar with how it works, the use of the stenographic keyboard, and the strokes in their dictionary.

The Dictionary is a mapping of chords or chord-combinations to specific (english) words or phrases.  Dictionaries can be built upon many different stenographic theories - so if you have already learned some machine stenography, you will want a dictionary built on the theory you have learned.

The default dictionary is taken from the Plover project, and is built on a synthesis of  NYCI and StenEd theories.
